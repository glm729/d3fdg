# D3: Force-Directed Graph Test
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### 2<sup>nd</sup> of February, 2021

**NOTE:  This project has been split from the main
[`anpc_public`](https://github.com/glm729/anpc_public/) repository as
it was becoming a bit complex to track and modify.**

This project aims to test and produce a force-directed graph visualisation of
certain recorded metabolites with data present in the KEGG databases, using the
[D3 library](https://d3js.org/).  Development of this visualisation is mainly
intended for use in [ChemInfo](https://cheminfo.org/) /
[Visualizer](https://github.com/npellet/visualizer/), and is being tested and
tracked locally.
