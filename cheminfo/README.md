# ChemInfo Cells
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### 18<sup>th</sup> of February, 2021

This directory contains the contents of the cells used in some of the ChemInfo
views.  This just makes it easier to keep a centralised record of versions and
changes, and to make it easier to restore if lost or edited beyond recognition.

### Operations

There are two main layers in the view -- the default layer, which is the main
interface, and the admin layer, which contains all of the code executor cells.
The contents of the cells are given here, plus perhaps one or two cells from or
for Twig templates.  There are a total of eight cells in use in the view.
