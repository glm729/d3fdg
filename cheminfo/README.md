# ChemInfo Cells
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### 28<sup>th</sup> of January, 2021

This directory contains the contents of the cells used in some of the ChemInfo
views.  This just makes it easier to keep a centralised record of versions and
changes, and to make it easier to restore if lost or edited beyond recognition.

### Operations

Currently, there are two main cells / scripts used.  One script handles
uploading a ZIP (of a known or specified format) and preparing it for download
while giving some feedback during operations, and another script defines a
background Object of functions used for handling the data.  The latter script
was initially generated by an external Ruby script, but some modifications have
been made to the contents which may not be reflected in the main scripts
directory.  The Ruby script to generate this Object is not currently given
here, but may be uploaded in the future.
