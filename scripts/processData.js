/**
 * Function for processing the data in the test page.  This function may be
 * modified frequently, as development and testing continues, at least until D3
 * is working in ChemInfo.
 *
 * No parameters, (technically) no output.  All hardcoded.  Just a way of
 * cheating when using FileReader, because I cannot comprehend it for some
 * reason.
 *
 * If anyone knows how to pass the FileReader.onload result when using
 * FileReader.readAsText, or assign it to a variable, or just some way of
 * getting file contents as raw text, please let me know.  The current
 * implementation uses callbacks and this function.  I've tried broad-scope
 * variables, and I'm trying to avoid just tacking it to the window, but
 * considering I've already done that, maybe I should use it again....
